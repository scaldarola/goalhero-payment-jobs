# GoalHero Payment Jobs Service

A microservice for handling payment processing, escrow management, and background jobs for the GoalHero sports platform.

## üéØ Purpose

GoalHero is a sports platform where organizers create games and players apply to join with competitive bids. This service manages the entire payment lifecycle from initial payment creation to final payout, with built-in escrow functionality to ensure fair transactions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

- **Payment Processing**: Stripe Connect integration with escrow functionality
- **Background Jobs**: Automated rating reminders, escrow releases, and dispute handling  
- **REST API**: Endpoints for payment operations and job management
- **Firebase Integration**: Authentication and Firestore database
- **Serverless Ready**: Designed for Vercel deployment with local development support

### Tech Stack

- **Language**: Go 1.21+
- **Web Framework**: Gin HTTP router
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Payment Provider**: Stripe Connect
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Deployment**: Vercel (serverless) + local development

## üí∞ Business Model

### Payment Flow
1. **Players apply** to games with bid amounts (‚Ç¨5-50)
2. **Organizers select** preferred players
3. **Payments processed** through Stripe with escrow
4. **Funds held** until game completion + rating
5. **Automatic release** to organizers based on performance ratings

### Fee Structure
- **Platform Fee**: 4% of game amount
- **Stripe Fee**: 1.65% + ‚Ç¨0.25 per transaction
- **Total Cost**: Game amount + Stripe processing fee
- **Organizer Nets**: Game amount - platform fee (after escrow release)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or higher
- Stripe test account with Connect enabled
- Firebase project with Firestore enabled

### Environment Setup
1. Copy environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Configure your environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Stripe Configuration
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here
   STRIPE_CONNECT_ACCOUNT=acct_test_your_connect_account
   STRIPE_TEST_MODE=true
   
   # Firebase Configuration  
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/firebase-service-account.json
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   
   # Server Configuration
   PORT=8081
   GO_ENV=development
   ```

### Local Development
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

2. Run the service:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

3. Service available at: `http://localhost:8081`

### Testing
Run the full test suite:
```bash
go test ./... -v
```

Test Stripe integration:
```bash
go run test_stripe_integration.go
```

Debug payment issues:
```bash
go run debug_stripe_payments.go
```

## üîÑ Payment Workflow

### 1. Payment Creation
```bash
POST /api/payments/games

  "gameId": "game_456",
  "applicationId": "app_789", 
  "organizerId": "acct_stripe_connect_id",
  "amount": 25.0
}
```

**Response**: Returns payment intent with `client_secret` for frontend completion.

### 2. Payment Completion

- Full background job system runs locally
- Gin router serves HTTP endpoints
- Uses port 8081 by default

## üîê Security

### Payment Security
- PCI compliance through Stripe (no card data stored)
- Stripe Connect for secure fund transfers
- Firebase Authentication for API access

### Access Control
- Public endpoints for payment operations
- Admin-only endpoints for job management
- Internal endpoints for service-to-service communication

## üìà Monitoring

### Health Checks
- `GET /` or `GET /ping` - Service health
- `GET /api/jobs/health` - Background job health
- Job status tracking with error counts and runtime metrics

### Key Metrics
- Payment success rates
- Escrow release timing
- Rating completion rates
- Background job performance
